Decoding Economic Determinants of Presidential Approval: Insights from Macro-Level Machine Learning Models

Abstract:

This study examines the economic determinants of U.S. presidential approval using a systematic, data-driven approach. Addressing limitations in prior research that relied on narrow, predefined economic indicators, the analysis employs Elastic Net and Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (\ac{SCAD}) variable selection techniques on a high-dimensional dataset spanning 1953-2023. From 10,699 lagged variables, the \ac{SCAD} model identified 42 relevant determinants, which were manually categorized into six groups: Public Sector Activity, Private Sector Activity, Housing and Mortgages, Monetary Policy, Recession, and Labor Market.

A Structural Vector Autoregression (\ac{SVAR}) framework was used to analyze the dynamic effects of these categories on approval ratings. The results indicate that public and private sector activity exert the strongest positive effects on presidential approval, while Monetary Policy and Labor Market variables also play significant roles. Housing and Mortgages exhibit longer lags before influencing approval, while Recession indicators reveal unexpected dynamics that merit further investigation.

These findings suggest a more complex relationship between economic conditions and presidential approval than previously understood. By uncovering dynamic and lagged effects, this study provides a robust framework for future research and offers insights for policymakers and political analysts.

Disclaimer:

The variable selection process, including the implementation of Elastic Net and Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD) regression techniques, was conducted on the High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster of the Justus Liebig University Giessen. These computational resources were critical for handling the high-dimensional dataset and optimizing the hyperparameters of the models. For replication purposes, users should ensure access to similar computational infrastructure, as these analyses require significant processing power and memory.
